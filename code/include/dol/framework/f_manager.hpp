/**
 * @brief Manages the execution of base operations.
 * @ingroup framework dol
 * @details
 * ## Overview
 * fManager_c manages the execution of base operations (which Nintendo calls processes) both at a local
 * and a global scale. It also offers a small base search API.
 *
 * ## Global Base Searching
 * Bases can be searched globally based on various criteria:
 * - Use ::searchBaseByID to find a base by its @ref fBase_c::mUniqueID "unique identifier".
 * - Use ::searchBaseByProfName to find bases using a certain @ref fProfile::PROFILE_NAME_e
 * "profile name".
 * - Use ::searchBaseByGroupType to find bases belonging to the given @ref fBase_c::GROUP_TYPE_e
 * "group type".
 * - The last two functions allow specifying a base to start the search from, in order to narrow
 * down its scope.
 *
 * See fBase_c for information on how to iterate the base tree manually.
 *
 * ## Operation Management
 * <i>For further details regarding operations, see fBase_c.</i>
 *
 * At a global scale, fManager_c handles operation execution through multiple linked lists. Each
 * list is dedicated to a specific operation, and contains all the bases for which the operation
 * is scheduled for the current frame.
 *
 * The ::mainLoop function goes through each list and carries out the associated operation
 * on every base contained within, by calling the list's @ref fLiMgPTMF_c::walkPack "walkPack" method.
 * The execution order is as follows:
 * - @p delete
 * - @p create
 * - @p execute
 * - @p draw
 * - @p connect
 *
 * Finally, an operation can be disabled globally by setting the ::m_StopProcInf flag. Disabling all
 * operations effectively halts the game, which can be useful for debugging.
 *
 * ## Implementation
 * Every instance of fManager_c is embedded inside a base, also known as its owner. The class
 * contains various list/tree nodes that link the owner base to the respective list/trees:
 * - ::mConnectNode connects the base to the @ref ::m_connectManage "connect tree", which allows it to
 * establish relationships with other bases. It is used during the @p connect operation.
 * - ::mMainNode allows the base to be scheduled for the @p create, @p execute and @p delete operations.
 * - ::mDrawNode allows the base to be scheduled for the @p draw operation.
 * - ::mSearchNode adds the base to one of the @ref ::m_searchManage "eight search lists", allowing it
 * to be indexed and searched for through the previously mentioned API.
 *
 * ## Unused Content
 * The aforementioned ::m_StopProcInf flag, while present and working, remains unchanged throughout
 * the whole game. Since its default value has no effects, it ultimately ends up unused.
